ADC

The analog-to-digital converters are Texas Instruments ADS7042 12-bit SAR ADCs with SPI interface.

DAC

The digital-to-analog converter is a Microchip MCP4822 12-bit 2-channel DAC with SPI interface.

The XLR input and output are single-channel, while the TRS input and output are two-channel.  XLR and TRS do not operate simultaneously.  So, the XLR channel and the TRS tip (or left channel) are combined.

Software

The software is based on Midifier C++ code.

Initially, all that is required is analog in to analog out through the processor.
